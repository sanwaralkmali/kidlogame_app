**`Application Flow Diagrams`** 

This section presents visual representations of the flow and interconnectivity between the different screens within the KidloGame 
application. The purpose of these flow diagrams is to ensure that every user journey within the app is well-thought- out and coherent. They serve as a blueprint, providing a clear picture of the application's functionality and guiding the development process. This essential step enables us to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless navigation for our end-users. It also helps to identify any potential user experience issues early in the process, allowing us to rectify them before actual development begins. These diagrams are pivotal in visualizing the app's structure and understanding how the various screens interact and relate to each other. 


**Login & Sign Up Screens Flow Diagram** 

This flow diagram illustrates the step-by-step navigation and interactivity of the Login and Sign Up screens of our KidloGame application. 
<br>

The process begins with the user opening the application and encountering a friendly graphic. Two tabs, "Login" and "Sign Up", allow users to choose between logging into an existing account or creating a new one. 
<br>

In the Login tab, users can enter their username or email and password, and then press the "Login" button to enter the app. There are also options to login using their Google or Apple ID accounts. If a user forgets their password, they can navigate to the "Forgot Password" screen to reset their password through a link sent to their email. 
<br>

In the Sign Up tab, users can choose to create an account using their Google or Apple ID. Otherwise, they can fill out the required fields (name, surname, email, and password). After successful validation, they will proceed to the "Continue" screen to finalize their profile. Here, they will select their gender (Boy or Girl), grade level, favorite subject, and fill out a text area for their interests. 
<br>

The flow diagram for these screens ensures all user pathways are clear and easy to follow, contributing to an enjoyable and efficient user experience.

**Home Screen Flow Diagram** 
<br>

The Home Screen Flow Diagram illustrates the navigation and interactivity of the main screen in the KidloGame application. The home screen, acting as the central hub of the application, is divided into three primary sections: 

New Game Button: This is where users can generate a new game tailored to their preferences. Upon clicking the button, the user is directed to the new game generator, where they can customize the game's parameters. 
<br>

Explore Subjects Section: This section showcases the various subjects available in the application. Users can browse through these subjects, and upon selection, a list of pre-generated games related to the chosen subject is displayed. 
<br>

Recommended Games Section: In this section, users are presented with a selection of ready-to-play games. These games are specifically recommended based on the user's preferences and current learning level. 
<br>

--------------------


**`Database Design`** 
<br>

The underlying database architecture plays a significant role in the performance, flexibility, and scalability of our application. As such, careful consideration has been given to the design of the database structure. Utilizing Firebase, a NoSQL cloud database, our data will be organized as a JSON tree, a flexible structure permitting the storage of complex nested data. This stands in contrast to traditional SQL databases characterized by tables and relations. 
<br>

**Outlined below is the proposed schema for our application: Users Collection** 

Each document in this collection represents a unique user, identified by a unique ID. The document encompasses fields including username, hashed password, email, grade, subject of interest, gender, level, and a subcollection of friend's IDs. 
<br>

**Subjects Collection** 

Each document in this collection symbolizes a unique subject, incorporating fields such as subject name, list of topics, and a subcollection for learning materials. 
<br>

**Topics Subcollection** 

Found within each subject document, this subcollection consists of documents representing unique topics. Fields include the topic name and a subcollection for questions. 
<br>

**Questions Subcollection** 

Nestled within each topic document, this subcollection comprises documents each denoting a unique question. Fields contained include question text, options, correct answer, difficulty level, and any other pertinent information. 
<br>

**Games Collection** 

This collection is composed of documents where each one embodies a unique game. Fields include game name, subject, topic, list of question IDs, player IDs, and game status (ongoing, finished). 
<br>

**Sessions Collection** 

Each document in this collection is a representation of a unique session. The fields encompassed include the user IDs of the participating players, game ID, start time, end time, and player scores. 
<br>

**Leaderboards Collection** 

Each document in this collection represents a leaderboard. Fields consist of subject, list of user IDs and scores, ordered by scores. 
<br>

**Friends Subcollection** 

Within each user document, this subcollection is made up of documents each representing a friend. Fields include friend user ID and friend username. 
<br>

The chosen Firebase platform allows for the "denormalization" of data. Consequently, data duplication is permissible, thus deviating from the traditional SQL databases where strict adherence to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle is required. This flexibility can expedite read times, albeit at the expense of a minor deceleration of writes. However, such an approach is often crucial to achieving the desired scalability.
